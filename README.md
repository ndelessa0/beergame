# beergame

This is a beer game I created using Flask in the Back-End and React in the Front-End. 
It also has tests which makes sure that our features work correctly. 
The code is the first commit. But this current commit will make sure User
Authentication works. It also creates the UI of the beer game but the game is not 
functional yet.

The game I am trying to recreate is like the one below.(Click the link)

But the version I am creating is tailored for our Universities Logistics Lab course.
